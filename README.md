# Android Studio: Image Labeling Project

For an assignment in CS160 - User Interface Design, I developed an application in Android Studio that uses Firebase API to 
recognize categories of objects. The task was to create a camera app that would use object recognition to draw boxes over 
key objects in the frame, with additional functionality to change the color of the boxes and labels being optional.

Check out my demo of the app here:
